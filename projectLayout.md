#Project Layout

Your Android project usually has several folders:
* `src` Your source code goes here, organized by package
* `bin` generated by eclipse, ignore
* `libs` where you can put jar files for your libraries
* `res` where you put your resource files, including
	* `drawable` (or drawable-* ). where you put your images
	* `layout` for your layout xml files
	* `values` (or values-* )for your values (this allows your apps to be much more flexible)
