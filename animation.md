#Animations in Android

Android allows us to define several kind of animations; we can define the animations in xml files, or with java code, and have some java code for starting animations and handling events like the animation starting etc. The kinds of animations are:

* [Drawable](http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/graphics/drawable-animation.html) animations display just a series of images (or Drawables) one after the other
* [Property](http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/graphics/prop-animation.html) animations let you animate any of a number of properties of a view, and are the most flexible.
* [View](http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/graphics/view-animation.html) animations are a somewhat older and less flexible version of property animations.
